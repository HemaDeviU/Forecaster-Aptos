## The Plan

Fantasy gaming based prediction market was our initial idea. We came to know about the hack just 4 days before, so we managed to pull an idea to code of the betting market on btc pricing.Had we known about the hack earlier,we would have chosen our elaborate idea. 

We plan to get grants for developer time and infra to expand the project to the Aptos mainnet by the end Q1 2025.

Focusing on long term on Forecaster , we plan to include
- Lottery page with scratch cards
- Price prediction based on other crypto prices by introducing gamified experience where usage unlocks NFTs with super-powers like increased multiplier to the winnings when the user bets.
- Improved animation and UX with account abstraction.
- NFT based rewards for referrals to the dapp that unlock gas sponsorshop for the bets places.
